# Performance Benchmark CI Integration

**Priority:** Medium
**Complexity:** High
**Type:** Infrastructure Enhancement

## Problem

Currently, performance benchmarks exist but are run manually. There's no automated protection against performance regressions being introduced in future changes.

## Challenges

- **State persistence**: How to maintain benchmark history across CI builds
- **Environment variability**: CI environments may have inconsistent performance characteristics
- **Baseline management**: Need to establish and maintain performance baselines over time
- **Noise filtering**: Distinguishing real regressions from environmental variance
- **Storage costs**: Long-term storage of benchmark data and artifacts

## Potential Solutions to Investigate

1. **GitHub Actions with artifact storage**
   - Store benchmark results as CI artifacts
   - Compare against previous runs with configurable thresholds
   - Challenge: Limited artifact retention policies

2. **External benchmark tracking services**
   - Services like Bencher.dev or custom dashboard
   - Persistent storage and visualization
   - Challenge: Additional service dependencies

3. **Repository-based tracking**
   - Commit benchmark results to a dedicated branch
   - Track performance over time in-repo
   - Challenge: Repository bloat over time

4. **Hybrid approach**
   - Run benchmarks on every PR
   - Only store significant changes/regressions
   - Alert on performance degradation beyond thresholds

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Automated benchmark execution on PRs
- [ ] Performance regression detection with configurable thresholds
- [ ] Historical performance tracking
- [ ] Clear alerts when regressions occur
- [ ] Minimal maintenance overhead
- [ ] Cost-effective storage solution

## Notes

This requires careful design to balance thoroughness with maintainability. Consider starting with a simple PR-based benchmark comparison before implementing full historical tracking.

The recent O(N²) → O(N) parser optimization demonstrates the value of performance monitoring - we achieved 268× improvement that should be protected going forward.
