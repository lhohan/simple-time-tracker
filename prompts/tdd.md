# TDD Guidelines

- Emphasize test stability by focusing on behavior rather than implementation details.
- Focus on verifying observable behaviors over implementation details in your tests.
- Utilize reusable builders and utilities to compose tests effectively.

Remember:

- Propose small, incremental steps to achieve functionality.
- Perform preparatory refactoring to accommodate new features without disrupting existing functionality.
- Begin with the smallest possible test, even if it requires hardcoding values, and iteratively refine the implementation.
- Red-Green-Refactor. Never forget the 'Refactor' step to keep things maintainable.
